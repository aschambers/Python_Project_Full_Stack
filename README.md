# Python_Project_Full_Stack
This was a project I worked on during the project week at Coding Dojo. My goal was to write a program
that would improve dispatch efficiency for a work place which is where technicians are sent, what time
of the day, there are multiple factors to consider. This project utilized the twilio API to send and 
recieve texts. This is just a sample of what you can do. My goal later would be improve the call/text
functionality of the buttons so your calling that tech directly. I am using the trial version
of twilio, so I can only use numbers I add to a list, was just for testing purposes anyways.
